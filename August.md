# Daily Notes for my Independent Study - August

## Monday, August 23

- Got C++ working with VSCode on my new mac
  - Had to install gcc and set my C++ compiler to cpp-11 for docs to work
- Found a HackerRank problem to work on for practice
  - Called clickomania, began building out the game structure

## Wednesday, August 25

- Continued work on Clickomania - finished the sliding functionality
  - Began work on the disjoint sets, structuring for the AI

## Thursday, August 26

- Met with Mr. Griest, considered expanding the project into the study
  - May increase the board size and test building out more complex AIs

## Monday, August 30

- Fixed disjoint set creation - reversed the sorting operator and equality operators
  - Also did some optimizations - no longer checking the set on each coordinate
  - This saves roughly 2 seconds per board - so it makes the AI like 2 million times faster

## Tuesday, August 31

- Added removing set of blocks and sliding functionality - works well together
  - Excited about making the AI for this - it's an interesting game
