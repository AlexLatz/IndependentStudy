# Daily Notes for my Independent Study - October

## Monday, October 4

- Began work on nice visualizer for the solver
- And a new scoring function

## Tuesday, October 5

- Had a meeting with Mr. Griest
  - While explaining the problem, found out that the number of moves does not factor into the problem
  - Modified it a little and didn't improve it - so more fixes to come
  - Scheduled my independent study presentation

## Friday, October 8

- Redid some of the unique-block sorting
  - As far as I can tell it counts as a loss as soon as you click on a one-block
  - So I started working through the processing during disjoint generation

## Monday, October 11

- More work towards unique-block detection, found issues with sliding
  - Fixed the slide issues, found disjoint generation issues with large groups
  - Going to be a complicated fix but the performance looks promising

## Thursday, October 14

- Finished configuring the A* to move with unique blocks in mind
  - Test case 1 on hackerrank runs into the disjoint issue in the last few moves

## Saturday, October 16

- Moved the clickomania A* into this repository instead of hackerrank
  - It's clearly grown to the point that it should be a part of the project
- Recorded a video for Dr. Olid with current progress and an explanation
