# Daily Notes for my Independent Study - April

## Friday, April 1

- Built the alpha-beta pruning portion of my Connect 4 AI
  - It was broken and I was running out of time to submit
  - Decided to push it to another branch and polish the project
- Added colors and polished the UI and error handling for submission
  - Ended up being 1 minute late because of checkstyle reconfig
  - Although Soumia said it might be due Monday OH
    - I could submit it with the AI then
- Fixed the AI - I accidentally wrote maximin search
  - Picked the worst possible moves (all in one column)
  - Also added a fix for feasible 3-in-a-row diags in the heuristic
  - It seems to be really good for now

    - had a cool way of doing terminal colors - supported in IntelliJ windows!
