# Daily Notes for my Independent Study

## Friday, March 19

- Meeting with Mr. Griest 
    - Starting my daily notes
    - Learning C++ through Accelerated CPP
    - SDL vs. SFML - decided probably SDL because of the low-level control
        - Important for writing the AI agents - need ability to control the environment
    - Digital note-taking - handwritten vs. digital, markdown or vim
        - Right now, leaning towards vim notes - we'll see what actually ends up being usable
    - Sharing digital notes through GitHub
    - For next week - continuing to learn C++, trying to find a good SDL resource
        - Finish chapter 5 exercises, potentially start chapter 6 notes
