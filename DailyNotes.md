# Daily Notes for my Independent Study

## Friday, March 19

- Meeting with Mr. Griest 
    - Starting my daily notes
    - Learning C++ through Accelerated CPP
    - SDL vs. SFML - decided probably SDL because of the low-level control
        - Important for writing the AI agents - need ability to control the environment
    - Digital note-taking - handwritten vs. digital, markdown or vim
        - Right now, leaning towards vim notes - we'll see what actually ends up being usable
    - Sharing digital notes through GitHub
    - For next week - continuing to learn C++, trying to find a good SDL resource
        - Finish chapter 5 exercises, potentially start chapter 6 notes

- Links
    - https://www.libsdl.org/ - SDL2 homepage
    - https://www.sfml-dev.org/ - SFML homepage
    - https://pandoc.org/ - digital notetaking converter - possibly chain into vim

- Deep dive into vim config on Windows
    - Almost done configuring on mac, decided to use WSL2 and Windows Terminal
	- (the new windows terminal is very nice)
    - May eventually consider switching back to Manjaro Linux w/ i3-gaps
    - Will do some more coding tmrw, just wanted to consider switching to vim for C++
	- vscode's C++ support is iffy on mac, and vim is very portable (nice for mult computers)
- I'll get to chapter 5 exercises tmrw, just wanted to work on env setup first

- Links
    - https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls - c++ language server
    - https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim - vim lsp autocompletion plugin
	- need these two for setting up vim c++ dev
